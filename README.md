# Dc-Electric-Car
This is my bachelor Project where I designed and built an electric car for 2 passengers that is powered exclusively by solar power, coping with the difficulty of limited resources in the egyptian market. One of my concerns was to make the car of components that are locally sourced. 

## Abstract:
This thesis deals with avoiding the reliance on the limited source of energy such as
petroleum, also as global warming increasingly threatens our planet earth. In this project, you find my strategy of
avoiding these two main problems by using renewable energy instead, which is limitless, free, and
pollution free. Developing the car using the sun as a sole source of energy for
supporting the car. Using solar panels, they collect it during the day for storing this
energy into batteries to be used to operate the car. Its major advantage lies in the fact that it is
simple and versatile, which makes it applicable to a large range of cars of different weight loads,
and different speeds.
