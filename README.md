# Dc-Electric-Car
This is my bachelor Project where I designed and built an electric car for 2 passengers that is powered mainly by solar power, coping with the difficulty of limited resources in the egyotian market. So I made the card of components that are localy resourced. 

Abstract
This thesis deals with avoiding the reliance on the limited source of energy such as
petroleum, also as the global warming increasingly threatening our planet earth. In an attempt to
avoid these two main problems is to use renewable energy instead, which is limitless, free, and
pollution free. Developing the car by using solar energy as their only source of energy for
supporting the car with energy. Using solar panels, they collect it during the day for storing this
energy into batteries to be used to operate the car. Its major advantage lies in the fact that it is
simple and versatile, which makes it applicable to a large range of cars of different weight loads,
and different speeds.
